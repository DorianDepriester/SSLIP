% set SSLIP method
% 1: constrained and minimized slip ID (As used predominantly in the SSLIP paper. 
% Contraint: || H^exp - H^their || < H_thresh. Minimzation of sum of absolute value of slip activities ) 

% 2: constrained slip ID (only solve problem based on the || H^exp - H^their || < H_thresh  constraint, no minimization)


% 3: single slip system ID (check for each pixel if a SINGLE system fits the activity. Used to "initialize" the SSLIP id om Figure 11 of the paper)
% Recommended as trial for uncertain/complex situations.

% pixels with low strain)

% Positive constraint: choose to constrain the slip amplitudes to be positive or not. This
% only works well if the slip systems are "configured" to have a positive
% amplitude under a certain load (which is normally assured in the main
% script, assuming e.g. uniaxial tension).
