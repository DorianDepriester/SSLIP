# SSLIP
Slip System based Identification of Local Plasticity (SSLIP): a methodology for automatic, point-by-point, identification of crystallographic slip system activity fields, performed by matching of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) displacement gradient fields to combinations of theoretical slip systems (resulting from e.g. EBSD).

The code will be online soon, apologies for the delay.
